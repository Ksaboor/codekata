# Code-Kata
A project to go over algorithms and bacis syntax

# The Plan
  
 I want to Keep my Java skills in check by writing the listed Algorithms and with simple workouts in between days. 
 
- [x] Check Unique
- [ ] Palindrome
- [X] Fibonacci
- [ ] Breadth-First Search
- [ ] Depth-First Search
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort

## Day 1
I type up some algorithms I have done from my past Technical Interviews
I'll have the Junit test setup by the end of night to properly test the methods.

## Day 2 
I want to write and create test cases for these problems.

- [x] Write a loop that will print all the whole numbers from 1 to 100.
- [x] Write a loop that will add all the whole numbers from 1 to 1000 and print only the total.
- [ ] Write a loop that will add all the ODD numbers from 1 to 300 and print only the total.
- [ ] Write a loop that will add all the EVEN numbers from 2 to 146 and print only the total.
- [ ] Write a loop that will add every 3rd number from 2000 to 6 and print the total. DO NOT flip the numbers around and count from 6 to 2000.

- [ ] Read in an integer value from the user and print out if the number is even or odd.
- [ ] Read in an integer value from the user from 1 and 100. Loop until a value in that range is entered. After a number in that range is entered print it out.

## End of Day 2
Gotta  remember to write test cases first before developing
Roll over unchecks to Sunday along with
Reverse A String problem.

# Day 3
- [ ] Write a loop that will add all the ODD numbers from 1 to 300 and print only the total.
- [ ] Write a loop that will add all the EVEN numbers from 2 to 146 and print only the total.
- [ ] Write a loop that will add every 3rd number from 2000 to 6 and print the total. DO NOT flip the numbers around and count from 6 to 2000.
- [ ] Reverse A String
- [ ] Read in an integer value from the user and print out if the number is even or odd.
- [ ] Read in an integer value from the user from 1 and 100. Loop until a value in that range is entered. After a number in that range is entered print it out.
