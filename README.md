# Code-Kata
A project to go over algorithms and bacis syntax

# The Plan
 
 I want to Keep my Java skills in check by writing the listed Algorithms and with simple workouts in between days. 
* Check Unique
* Reverse A String
* Palindrome
* Fibonacci
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## Day 1
I type up some algorithms I have done from my past Technical Interviews
I'll have the Junit test setup by the end of night to properly test the methods.

## Day 2
I want to write and create test cases for these problems.

* Write a loop that will print all the whole numbers from 1 to 100.
* Write a loop that will add all the whole numbers from 1 to 1000 and print only the total.
* Write a loop that will add all the ODD numbers from 1 to 300 and print only the total.
* Write a loop that will add all the EVEN numbers from 2 to 146 and print only the total.
* Write a loop that will add every 3rd number from 2000 to 6 and print the total. DO NOT flip the numbers around and count from 6 to 2000.

* Read in an integer value from the user and print out if the number is even or odd.
* Read in an integer value from the user from 1 and 100. Loop until a value in that range is entered. After a number in that range is entered print it out.
